/**
 * Regenerate the conformance session's recorded runtime, reproducibly.
 *
 *   npm --prefix web run conformance:record -- <jpack binary> <project dir>
 *   npm --prefix web run conformance:verify -- <jpack binary> <project dir>
 *
 * `record` writes `src/assistant/conformance/runtime.json`; `verify` records to
 * memory and byte-compares against the committed file, so a hand-edited or
 * stale fixture is a failure rather than a claim.
 *
 * **Why this exists.** The fixture used to carry its provenance as prose — a
 * tag and a short commit — with no way to check it and no recorder in the
 * repository. A recorded answer somebody edited by hand would have gone on
 * calling itself recorded, and the conformance session would have been
 * certifying engines against it. The fixture now carries the binary's SHA-256
 * and the runtime's full commit, and this file is what put them there.
 *
 * **Byte-determinism.** The runtime's answers to these six calls carry no
 * timestamp, no run id and no path: the recorder writes them exactly as they
 * arrived, with a stable member order and a trailing newline, so two runs of
 * the same binary over the same project produce the same bytes. `verify` is
 * what says so; it is not asserted here.
 *
 * It is `.mjs` rather than TypeScript because it drives a subprocess and runs
 * under plain node, outside the page's toolchain and outside `tsc`'s program.
