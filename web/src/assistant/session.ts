/**
 * One assistant session: its own connection, its own gate, one event stream.
 *
 * **The assistant gets its own MCP connection, and this is where that is
 * decided.** The desk's one client serves the page's own calls — `list_packs`,
 * `get_pack`, the what-if pane's `experimental_evaluate` — and every one of
 * them is outside the assistant's allow-list, so the gate cannot sit on that
 * transport without breaking the desk. A second `DeskWebSocketTransport` is
 * opened instead, wrapped by the ToolGate, with its own `Client`; the chassis
 * spawns one more `jpack mcp` behind it, and it lives exactly as long as the
 * session. That is the price of a guarantee held at the wire rather than at a
 * call site, and it is in the README.
 *
 * **The guardrail events are the desk's, not an engine's.** The gate reports
 * what it did, and this module turns each notice into the ADR's `guardrail`
 * event on the same ordered sink the engine's events go to — so a refusal
 * lands between the `tool_call` that provoked it and the `tool_result` the
 * engine got back, which is the order a reader needs to make sense of either.

 * - **the answer is a facade**, constructed by this desk. A browser `Response`

 *   *this desk's routing* rather than a secret — since the session became an id
 *   the page holds and sends on a header, there is no credential in any address
 *   for an engine to read, and an engine that constructed `/ws` would still have
 *   to present that id. So the facade is defence in depth and is stated as
 *   that: what an engine is *handed* is held by the member set in
 *   `enforcement.test.ts`, and what an engine *reaches for* is caught by the
 *   conformance suite, whose sealed globals make that a failing test rather than
 *   something the running desk prevents. The same reasoning covers the failure
 *   path: the error is replaced, because a fetch `TypeError` quotes the URL and
 *   an engine is handed no address;
 * - **the headers are an allow-list**, in both directions, so nothing
 *   resembling a credential travels even as far as this desk's own route and
 *   nothing but the protocol's own comes back;
 * - **`fetch` is captured when the session is bound**, not read at call time,
 *   so the conformance session can replace every network global with a
 *   throwing sentinel for the whole of an engine's leg. An engine that reaches
 *   for one fails; this call still works.
 *
 * `family` is the configured endpoint's wire protocol, and it is a **parameter
 * of the binding rather than of the call**: it decides whether the one query
 * pair the relay admits may travel, and an engine that could name it would be
 * an engine choosing what its endpoint admits. It is required rather than
 * defaulted, because a default is a grant nobody wrote down.
