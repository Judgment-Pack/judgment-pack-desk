/**
 * The thinking tier, normalized in the desk.
 *
 * ADR-0001: *"The tier maps to provider parameters in one desk-owned table, per
 * endpoint family, and the engine receives the normalized result. The slot has
 * five states, three of them measured: `off`, `on`, `ultra`, **"this model
 * always thinks"** and **"unavailable for this endpoint"**. No framework
 * supplies the last two; they are desk code whichever engine runs."*
 *
 * So this module is the whole of what an engine is allowed to know about
 * thinking: **one table**, one closed list of refusals, one lifecycle, and one
 * sentence per state. An engine reads members off the slot and puts them on the
 * wire; it never chooses a parameter, never decides what a 400 meant, and never
 * writes a line about the tier.
 *
 * **`off` is expressed by omission on two families, and by a member on the
 * third.** Anthropic rejects `{"type":"disabled"}` on the models that always
 * think, and several OpenAI-compatible endpoints answer 400 to
 * `reasoning_effort: "none"`, so *send nothing* is the only spelling of off
 * those two accept. On the native Gemini wire the opposite is true: **omission
 * means thinking**, because the models that carry a `thinkingConfig` at all
 * reason by default, so "send nothing" would be asking for thinking by
 * accident. Off is therefore `thinkingBudget: 0` there — the field the API
 * reference documents for exactly this — and the difference is stated rather
 * than smoothed over, because it is the reason the table is per family.
 *
 * That, in turn, is why "this model always thinks" has two ways to be reached.
 * On the two omitting families it is **detected from reasoning arriving with
 * the tier off**: with nothing sent there is no request for an endpoint to
 * refuse. On the Gemini wire it may also be **the endpoint refusing to be
 * turned off** — a 400 naming the member, at every spelling this desk knows —
 * and that one is immediate, because a refusal is the endpoint saying so.
 *
 * Ported from the bake-off's `none` prototype (`fixture/THINKING-SPEC.md`, and
 * `none/src/thinking.ts`), and extended to the third family this desk
 * configures.
