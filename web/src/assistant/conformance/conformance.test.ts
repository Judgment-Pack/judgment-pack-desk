/**
 * The desk's conformance session: the bake-off's scenario, in the repository,
 * in CI.
 *
 * ADR-0001 makes certification the price of shipping an engine — "an engine
 * ships only if it passes the desk's conformance session in CI, which is the
 * bake-off scenario carried into the repository" — so this is not a test of
 * the built-in engine. It is a test of **every engine in the registry**, run
 * over the same scenario, and an adapter is certified by adding its id to
 * `CERTIFIED_ENGINES`.
 *
 * Keyless, deterministic, offline: a scripted model as a `fetch` stub, a
 * recorded runtime on an in-memory transport pair, no binary and no network.
 * The whole path is exercised — the ToolGate on a real transport, a real SDK
 * `Client`, the engine's own wire code — so what is measured is what the page
 * does and not a rehearsal of it.
 *
 * Four legs: OpenAI-compatible and Anthropic, each answered as a stream and as
 * one whole object. The second of each pair is not decoration: an endpoint may
 * ignore `stream`, and an engine that parsed by what it *asked for* would read
 * a JSON object as an event stream.
 *
 * The checks are the experiment's own, by their own names:
 *
 * - **K1** no credential in any request, and only the relay's base is called.
 * - **K2** the tools offered to the model are the five, taken from
 *   `tools/list`, with the runtime's own schemas — and no engine source
 *   carries a schema literal (asserted in `assistant/enforcement.test.ts`).
 * - **K3a** `experimental_evaluate` is rewritten to carry `rehearsal: true`,
 *   measured at the scripted server rather than at the page.
 * - **K3b** `write_file` never reaches the runtime.
 * - **K3c** the proposal's document is DRAFT_V2, byte for byte.
 * - **T8** the unknowns arrive as the scenario wrote them.
 * - the event stream's shape and order, and `end` exactly once.

 *   when the drain finishes.
 * - **An unhandled rejection is invisible here.** The one defect ADR-0001
 *   records against the default engine is a rejection the caller cannot claim
 *   reaching the *page*. These legs run in jsdom under Node, where such a
 *   rejection goes to Node's own handler and never becomes a `window` event, so
 *   neither the seal nor the drain can observe it. The guard the ADR asks for is
 *   exercised in `engines/vercel/engine.test.ts` instead, by dispatching the
