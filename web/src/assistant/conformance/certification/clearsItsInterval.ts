/**
 * A certification fixture that keeps **one** of the two rules and breaks the
 * other.
 *
 * The interval rule is "a certified engine leaves no live interval when its
 * iterator ends", and a rule that fails everything proves as little as one that
 * fails nothing. This engine starts an interval and clears it — so the interval
 * rule has nothing to say about it — and still reaches the network from a
 * timeout, which the drain catches.
 *
 * It also cancels a timer it scheduled, which is the other half of the same
 * point: a handle the engine itself cleared must never be run on its behalf. A
 * drain that fired cancelled handles would report a reach this engine did not
 * make.
 *
 * And it reaches from a **microtask**, with a `clearTimeout(undefined)` beside
 * it — the defensive line every library carries. A schedule that returns no
 * handle cannot be cancelled by a handle nobody was given, and a harness that
 * filed microtasks under `undefined` read that line as cancelling this one.
 *
 * It is not in `CERTIFIED_ENGINES` and never will be.
