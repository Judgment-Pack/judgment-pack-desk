/**
 * The bake-off's scripted model, in TypeScript, as a `fetch` stub.
 *
 * A port of `fixture/scripted_model.py` from
 * `docs/experiments/2026-09-05-assistant-engine-bakeoff`: the same step logic
 * (`count_openai`, `count_anthropic`, `choose_step`), the same two wire
 * formats, the same SSE grammars, the same repeat detector — and, from
 * `fixture/THINKING-SPEC.md`, the thinking gates per wire format, the
 * deterministic reasoning text and signatures, the `-nothink` degrade, the
 * split-signature probe and the critic script. What is dropped is the run-id
 * bookkeeping, which existed so several candidates could share one HTTP server.
 *
 * **Server mode is not the same as client request.** With thinking on, a
 * request that carries no thinking parameter is answered exactly as it would be
 * with thinking off, and the row records `thinkingRequested: false`. That
 * asymmetry *is* the measurement: an engine that cannot configure the parameter
 * produces a run where every row says `false`.
 *
 * **It decides the next step from the conversation, not from a counter it
 * keeps.** n is the number of scenario tool results already present in the
 * request's own messages; the answer is step n+1. So a session that dropped a
 * result, replayed a turn, or rebuilt its message array wrongly gets a
 * different script — which is what makes this a test of the engine's message
 * handling and not only of its parsing.
 *
 * It also **records every request**: the header names, the tool names offered,
 * the message count and the URL, which is what `requests.jsonl` carried in the
 * experiment and what K1 and K2 are read off here.

 * - `split` — `on`, with the Anthropic signature sent as two `signature_delta`
 *   events. Real Anthropic sends one; a re-chunking proxy is the case.
 * - `enabled-only` — refuses `thinking: {"type":"adaptive"}` with a 400 and
 *   accepts the token-budget spelling, which is the dialect fallback's leg.
 * - `nothink` — 400 `Unsupported parameter` to any request carrying a thinking
 *   parameter at all, which is the degrade's leg.
 * - `always` — a model that reasons whatever it was asked for, which is the
 *   `always` state's leg by **absence**: the desk asks for none, gets thought
 *   parts anyway, and the two-consecutive-turns rule settles it.
 * - `no-off` — a Gemini model that cannot be turned off: 400 to a request
 *   asking for a zero budget or the minimal level, and thought parts otherwise.
 *   That is the `always` state's leg by **refusal**, which is immediate — and
 *   the refusal is answered at *both* spellings, so a run reaches it only after
 *   the dialect fallback has been tried.
 * - `level-only` — a Gemini model that takes `thinkingLevel` and answers 400
 *   to `thinkingBudget`, which is that family's dialect fallback leg.
 * - `refuses-a-keyword` — an endpoint that refuses a **schema** keyword the
