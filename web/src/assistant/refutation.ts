 * The refutation pass: a second, adversarial run over the proposed document,

 * ADR-0001: *"Implemented per engine on the framework's natural primitive, and
 * held to three desk rules the bake-off showed no prototype kept on its own: a
 * non-empty list of checks before 'not refuted' is rendered; the verdict is
 * never taken from the model's prose, only from the runtime's results; and the
 * critic runs inside the same ToolGate as the main loop."*
 *
 * The **primitive** is each engine's — a second loop in `builtin`, a second
 * `streamText` in `vercel`. Everything a person is shown is here, in one
 * module both import, for the reason the ToolGate's allow-list is one list: a
 * rule written twice is a rule two readers can disagree about, and this one is
 * *whether a document was refuted*.
 *
 * **The critic's tools are the session's, which is what the third rule means.**
 * Neither engine builds the critic a dispatch of its own: it runs on the same
 * `guardedCallTool`, over the same five tools, through the same ToolGate on the
 * same transport — so its `experimental_evaluate` is rewritten to a rehearsal
 * before the frame leaves the page, and it can no more reach `write_file` than
 * the main loop can. The desk exposes no ungated route to an engine at all, and
 * the mutation that removes the gate takes the critic with it.
 *
 * **Nothing here writes.** The pass runs after the main loop produced a
 * proposal and *before* the proposal event is emitted, and every call it makes
 * is a read.
