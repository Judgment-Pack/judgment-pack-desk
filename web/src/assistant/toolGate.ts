/**
 * The ToolGate: the desk's promises about what the assistant may reach, held
 * **on the wire** rather than anywhere an engine could be wrong.
 *
 * ADR-0001 puts this below the engine slot deliberately. Every outbound
 * `tools/call` frame is checked by name against the session's allow-list and
 * refused otherwise; `experimental_evaluate` is rewritten to carry
 * `rehearsal: true` before the frame leaves the page. A loop that asked for a
 * tool it was never offered, an SDK retry, a second caller nobody has written
 * yet — each is stopped at the same place, because the place is the transport
 * and not a branch in whatever is running above it.
 *
 * **This is a `Transport`, not a wrapper around `callTool`.** The bake-off
 * measured both layers and reported that only this one survives the loop above
 * it being wrong: `Client`'s public surface offers no outbound middleware over
 * a WebSocket (`setRequestHandler` serves inbound requests; the fetch
 * middleware is for HTTP transports), so a gate on the call site is a gate one
 * `client.callTool` away from being bypassed. There is exactly one door and it
 * is `send`.
 *
 * **The allow-list is the configured subset, intersected with the five.** The
 * desk's closed list (`ASSISTANT_TOOLS`) is the ceiling and `endpoint.tools`
 * is what this desk's file granted; a name in neither cannot be reached by
 * writing a longer list somewhere else.
 *
 * **Order is allow-list, then rewrite**, and it matters in one case only:
 * `experimental_evaluate` that the file did not grant is *refused*, not
 * rewritten and sent. Rewriting first would turn a tool nobody granted into a
 * tool this desk politely corrected on its way out.
 *
 * `inspectOutboundFrame` is exported on its own so a test can call it with a
 * frame and no socket — the prototype's `assertOutboundFrame`, kept as a pure
 * function for exactly that reason.

 * classification made about a mutable object is a classification the object can
 * change out from under you. A `method` getter can answer `undefined` while the
 * gate is looking and `tools/call` while `JSON.stringify` is; a response-shaped
 * object with a `toJSON` can serialize as a request. So the object is serialized
 * once, the bytes are parsed back to plain data, and every rule below is applied
 * to that plain data — which has no getters, no `toJSON`, no functions, no
 * symbol keys and no prototype left to disagree with.
 *
 * What is checked, in order:
 *
 * 1. the frame survives a JSON round trip at all (a cycle does not) and is a
 *    plain object;
 * 2. `jsonrpc` is exactly `"2.0"`;
 * 3. it is exactly one of three shapes — a **request** (a string `method`, an
 *    `id` that is a string or a number, `params` absent or a plain object), a
 *    **notification** (a string `method`, no `id`), or a **response** (an `id`,
 *    exactly one of `result` and `error`, and no `method`). Anything else is
 *    refused;
 * 4. a method that is not `tools/call` but is a spelling of it to some other
 *    reader — `Tools/Call`, ` tools/call ` — is refused, on the chassis' own
 *    reasoning about its query;
 * 5. for `tools/call`: the tool is on the session's allow-list, and
 *    `experimental_evaluate` gets an own `rehearsal: true` written last onto
 *    the canonical arguments.
