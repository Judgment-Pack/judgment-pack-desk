/**
 * The engine contract, as ADR-0001 writes it.
 *
 * An engine is a module the page loads for one session. It receives everything
 * the desk has already decided — the runtime's prompt, the runtime's own tool
 * definitions, a bound `callTool`, the relay's base URL, the tier, an abort
 * signal — and returns a stream of events. Accept and Reject are the desk's
 * actions on the proposal, not engine calls.
 *
 * **Deliberately smaller than any framework's API.** What a framework offers
 * beyond this — its own approval pause, its own memory, its own file tools —
 * stays inside its adapter or is not used. That is the whole point of the slot:
 * the desk's promises are held below the loop, so swapping the loop changes
 * none of them.
 *
 * **`Engine`, not `AssistantEngine`.** The ADR writes the interface as
 * `AssistantEngine`, and this page already spells `AssistantEngine` as the
 * *identifier* a `desk.json` may name (`config/deskConfig.ts`). One name with
 * two meanings in one page is worse than a deviation recorded here: the id
 * keeps the name it has in configuration, and the adapter is `Engine`.
 *
 * **The session carries capabilities and never addresses.** `callTool` is a
 * function with no other member, so an engine cannot reach the transport the
 * ToolGate sits on, cannot open a second one, and cannot call a tool by any
 * route the gate does not see. `model.call` is the same shape for model
 * traffic. The member set is asserted whole in
 * `assistant/enforcement.test.ts`, because the guarantee is "there is nothing
 * else here" rather than "the obvious escape hatch is absent".
 *
 * **`model` is a capability, not a base URL — a deliberate deviation from
 * ADR-0001's contract sketch**, which wrote
 * `model: { family, baseUrl, model }` with `baseUrl` "the chassis relay". The
 * relay used to authenticate with this chassis' session token in the query, so
 * a `baseUrl` an engine could read was **this desk's credential in the engine's
 * hands** — an adapter holding it could open `/ws?token=…` itself with
 * `globalThis.WebSocket` and drive a third, ungated MCP connection.
 *
 * **That reading of the deviation is now out of date, and the deviation
 * stands.** The session is an `HttpOnly` cookie the browser attaches to every
 * same-origin request by itself, so no address is a credential and page code
 * that spelled `/ws` would be admitted on the cookie alone. Withholding the URL
 * was never the load-bearing part in any case: the token lived in
 * `sessionStorage`, which is same-origin readable, so an adapter that wanted it
 * could always have read it. What the capability actually buys is that the
 * desk decides **what** an engine can reach — one mount point, a validated path
 * suffix, no header outside the relay's own allow-list — rather than handing
 * over an address and hoping. So the engine is still handed no URL:
 * `model.call(suffix, init)` is a capability the desk binds, and it is the only
 * way an engine reaches a model at all.
 *
 * **What holds that, and what does not.** The member set below is asserted
 * whole, so an engine is *handed* nothing but the capability. It is not
 * prevented from reaching a global: in production an engine runs with the real
 * `fetch` and the real `WebSocket`, and one that spelled `/ws` itself would be
 * admitted on the session this page holds, which page code can read out of
 * `sessionStorage` exactly as it could once read the token there. The sealed
 * globals belong to the
 * conformance suite, which runs every engine's leg with `fetch`, `WebSocket`,
 * `XMLHttpRequest` and `EventSource` replaced by throwing sentinels — so an
 * engine that reaches for one **fails the suite**. That is regression coverage,
 * not runtime isolation: an engine opening its own connection is a bug this
 * repository catches before it ships, not one the running desk prevents.
 *
 * The conformance session holds that structurally rather than by inspection:
 * every leg runs with `fetch`, `WebSocket`, `XMLHttpRequest` and `EventSource`
 * replaced by throwing sentinels for the duration of the engine's run, so an
 * engine that reaches for any of them fails the leg. When the `vercel` adapter
 * lands, this capability is what is passed as the provider's `fetch` option,
 * so the shape survives the next chunk.
