/**
 * The one seam between the AI SDK and the desk: a `fetch` the SDK is given and
 * the desk's capability behind it.
 *
 * The SDK's providers are built with a **placeholder origin the adapter never
 * resolves** and this function as their `fetch`. So the SDK composes an
 * absolute URL, as it always does, and what it composes is reduced here to the
 * path suffix `session.model.call` admits — the desk builds the address, adds
 * this chassis' session token, and the relay attaches the model credential on
 * the far side. Nothing in this adapter holds a URL with the desk's origin in
 * it, and no engine code calls `globalThis.fetch`: the conformance session
 * seals it for the duration of every run.
 *
 * Three things happen here that the SDK must not be trusted to do:
 *
 * - **the address is checked**, twice over. Anything that is not a path under
 *   the placeholder origin is refused, and so is a query of any kind. The
 *   desk's capability refuses both again — a suffix rule mirrored from the
 *   chassis — and both layers are tested, because "the SDK would never do
 *   that" is a premise and not a rule;
 * - **the credential is stripped.** `createAnthropic` throws `LoadAPIKeyError`
 *   in a browser with no key (`loadApiKey`, reached from its `getHeaders`), so
 *   the provider is handed a placeholder that never leaves this function. Every
 *   header outside the protocol's own is dropped here, and the desk's
 *   capability drops everything outside its own allow-list again;
 * - **the answer is presented in the framing the SDK asked for.** See below.
