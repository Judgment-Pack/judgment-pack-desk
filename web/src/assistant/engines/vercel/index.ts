/**
 * `vercel` — the default engine ADR-0001 names, and the second the desk ships.
 *
 * One object implementing one contract. Everything it can reach passes through
 * a seam the desk owns: `callTool` is bound through the ToolGate, and its model
 * traffic goes to the chassis relay with no credential of its own — the SDK's
 * providers are constructed against a placeholder origin and a `fetch` that is
 * the desk's own capability. Swapping this engine for the built-in one changes
 * none of those seams, which is what the slot is for.
