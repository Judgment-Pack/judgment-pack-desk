/**
 * One ordered channel between a framework's callbacks and the contract's
 * iterator.
 *
 * The built-in engine is an async generator all the way down, so `yield` is the
 * only ordering there is. A framework loop is not: `streamText` calls a tool's
 * `execute` from inside its own pipeline, and an adapter cannot `yield` from
 * there. What it can do is put the event on this channel and **wait until the
 * consumer has taken it**, which is the property the whole event order rests on:
 *
 *   `tool_call` delivered → `session.callTool` → *the desk's gate reports here*
 *   → `tool_result` delivered
 *
 * The guardrail event is the **desk's** and travels on the desk's own sink, not
 * on this channel (`assistant/session.ts` puts it there). So it lands between
 * the two only if the `tool_call` has already reached the consumer when the
 * gate fires — a queue that merely buffers would put the refusal *before* the
 * call it refused, which is the order a reader cannot make sense of.
 *
 * `push` therefore resolves after the consumer's `for await` body has run for
 * that event, and not before. There is no deadlock in that: the consumer pulls
 * from `drain()` while the framework's pipeline is driven from a separate task,
 * so a blocked `execute` is backpressure and not a cycle.
 *
 * **`abandon()` exists because a consumer may stop listening.** A pane that
 * unmounts, a `break`, a `return()` on the iterator: whatever is waiting on a
 * delivery that will never happen must be released, or the framework's task
 * runs for ever behind a page nobody is looking at.
 *
 * **And the event being yielded when that happens is the one `abandon()` cannot
 * see.** `drain` takes an entry off the queue *before* yielding it, so a
 * consumer that stops at exactly that event leaves a delivery nothing is
 * holding: not the queue, because it was taken off; not the resumed loop,
 * because it never resumes. `drive()` would wait on that `push` for ever and
 * `runVercel`'s `finally` would wait on `drive()`. So the generator settles the
 * entry it was yielding from a `finally` of its own, on **every** exit path —
 * its own return, a consumer's `return()`, a throw — and abandons the rest with
 * it.

/**
 * A second consumer, refused.
 *
 * **One channel, one consumer, by contract.** The in-flight slot is a single
 * slot because there is a single reader: two drains taking concurrently would
 * overwrite each other's, and the entry that was overwritten would be in
 * neither the queue nor the slot — a delivery nothing could ever settle, which
 * is the defect one layer up from the one this channel already fixed. Tracking
 * a slot per drain would *support* a second reader instead, and supporting one
 * would be inventing a use nobody has: the events of a run are an ordered
 * stream and splitting them between two readers has no meaning.
 *
 * So the second reader is refused **before it takes anything**, by name, and
 * the first reader and every queued push are left exactly as they were.
