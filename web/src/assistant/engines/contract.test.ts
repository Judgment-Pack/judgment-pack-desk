/**
 * The contract's own vocabulary, held where both engines read it.
 *
 * Most of what is here is the iterator every engine is wrapped in, because it
 * is the piece with a property neither engine's suite can state on its own: an
 * async generator serves `next()`, `return()` and `throw()` from **one queue**,
 * so a `return()` arriving while a `next()` is pending is not run until that
 * `next()` settles. A run waiting on a model request that ends only when it is
 * aborted could therefore never be stopped by the consumer that owned it — the
 * abort was inside the `return()` that was queued behind the very `next()` it
 * would have released. Both hung for ever, on both engines, measured.
