/**
 * The engine registry: one lazily loaded chunk per certified engine.
 *
 * ADR-0001 makes the engine a slot and certification the price of shipping one:
 * an engine is here only once it has passed the desk's conformance session,
 * which is `assistant/conformance/` and runs in CI against **this list**. So
 * adding an adapter is one line here plus its module — and the suite certifies
 * it or the suite goes red.
 *
 * **Every engine a `desk.json` may name is certified in this build, and there is
 * one table that says so.** The loaders are total over `AssistantEngine`, the
 * certified list is *derived* from them rather than written beside them, and the
 * two are asserted equal at the type level — so an id cannot become loadable
 * without being put in front of the conformance session, and an id the decoder
 * declares cannot be left without an adapter. The substitution this used to do —
 * a desk configured for `vercel` running `builtin` and a line in the tab saying
 * so — is gone with the reason for it.
 *
 * The loaders are `import()` so a session downloads one chunk. The release
 * grows by the sum of certified engines; a session does not.
